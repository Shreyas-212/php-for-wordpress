# PHP for WordPress

This repository contains my PHP practice code focused specifically on
concepts that are commonly used in WordPress theme and plugin development.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen my PHP fundamentals
before and while working with WordPress.

## Why this repository exists

WordPress is built on PHP.  
Before writing plugins and themes, it is important to be comfortable with
core PHP concepts such as functions, arrays, loops, and conditionals, etc.

This repository is used as a learning sandbox for those concepts.

## How this connects to WordPress

The PHP concepts practiced here are later applied in:
- WordPress themes (`index.php`)
- WordPress plugins
- Hooks and filters
- Template logic
